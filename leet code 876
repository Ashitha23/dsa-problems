in this we are using hair and tortise
where the steps covered by tortise is 1
the steps covered by fast is 2
show by taking the linked list 1,2,3,4,5
we will insert both slow and fast at 1
next we r shifting both of them slow is at 2,fast is at 3
and we r shiting it again since we r having elements in this
now slow is at 3 and fast is at 5
further we cant move it show the point where the slow has stopped is known as the middle elemet in the given linked list
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow=fast=head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
        return slow
